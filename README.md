# PandaPlacer

## Description

A craftable placer block that can place blocks. It is crafted and textured as a dispenser, and it is crafted like one except a piston instead of a bow. This mod runs purely on the server-side and doesn't require using client-side mods. It holds the rotations and can place rotated player heads/banners depending on how it is placed. It can also place blocks upside down depending on the orientation of the placer. This mod supports PandaBlockNames & PandaHeads.
